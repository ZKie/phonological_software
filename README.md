# Phonological software repository

A repository containing links to useful phonological software. The goal is to provide a one-stop shop for phonology-related software.

If you want to add any resources to this repository, please open a pull request with your proposed changes, or email cjmayer@uci.edu.

## Optimality theory

### General
* [OTSoft](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/otsoft/): A Windows program that implements several constraint ranking/weighting procedures, as well as other useful procedures.

### Maxent OT
* [Hayes and Wilson learner](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/Phonotactics/index.htm): A Java program that learns MaxEnt phonotactic grammars from positive data.
* [maxent.ot](https://github.com/connormayer/maxent.ot): An R package for fitting and evaluating MaxEnt OT grammars.
* [Maxent Grammar Tool](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/MaxentGrammarTool/): A Java tool for fitting MaxEnt grammars.

## Phonological class learning
* [Distributional learner](https://github.com/connormayer/distributional_learning): A Python program that learns phonological classes from distributional information.

## Phonological feature learning
* [Featurizer](https://github.com/connormayer/featurizer): A Python program that learns phonological feature systems from a set of input classes.

## Phonotactic learning
* [Phonotactic Language Model](https://github.com/MaxAndrewNelson/Phonotactic_LM): A Python program that learns phonotactics using recurrent neural networks.

## Formal language phonology
* [pTSL](https://github.com/connormayer/pTSL): A Python program for implementing and fitting probabilistic tier-based strictly local grammars.
