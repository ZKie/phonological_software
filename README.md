# Phonological software repository

A repository containing links to useful phonological software. The goal is to provide a one-stop shop for phonology-related software.

## How to contribute

### Guidelines

* Software described in published papers or conference proceedings is preferred
* Please provide a link to an implementation. This could be a GitHub repo or some other website hosting the code.
* Please place your resource in the appropriate section. If there is no topic you feel adequately describes your software, you can add a new topic or subtopic.
* Please indicate which language the program is written in.

### Adding a new resource

The best way to add a new resource is to create a pull request via the GitHub user interface.

1. Click on the edit button in the top right corner of this file.

2. This will let you edit the Markdown of the file. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for information about Markdown syntax. Add your entry.

3. Click the "Preview changes" tab at the top of the page to verify your entry is formatted correctly.

4. Once you're happy with your changes, scroll to the buttom of the page to the box labeled "Commit changes". Add a name for your proposed change and a description if you wish. Select ""Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" and then click "Propose file change".

If you are uncomfortable using GitHub, you can email cjmayer@uci.edu with your proposed changes.


## Optimality theory

### General
* [OTSoft](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/otsoft/): A Windows program that implements several constraint ranking/weighting procedures, as well as other useful procedures.

### Maxent OT
* [Hayes and Wilson learner](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/Phonotactics/index.htm): A Java program that learns MaxEnt phonotactic grammars from positive data.
* [maxent.ot](https://github.com/connormayer/maxent.ot): An R package for fitting and evaluating MaxEnt OT grammars.
* [Maxent Grammar Tool](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/MaxentGrammarTool/): A Java tool for fitting MaxEnt grammars.

## Phonological class learning
* [Distributional learner](https://github.com/connormayer/distributional_learning): A Python program that learns phonological classes from distributional information.

## Phonological feature learning
* [Featurizer](https://github.com/connormayer/featurizer): A Python program that learns phonological feature systems from a set of input classes.

## Phonotactic learning
* [Phonotactic Language Model](https://github.com/MaxAndrewNelson/Phonotactic_LM): A Python program that learns phonotactics using recurrent neural networks.

## Formal language phonology
* [pTSL](https://github.com/connormayer/pTSL): A Python program for implementing and fitting probabilistic tier-based strictly local grammars.
